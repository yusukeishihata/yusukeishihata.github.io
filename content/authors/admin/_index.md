I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in economics at Duke University.
My research interests lie in labor economics, the economics of the family, and the economics of education, with a particular focus on structural methods.
I have broad theoretical and empirical interests in topics such as job search, marriage market matching, fertility, and intra-household decision-making.
